We have learned a lot from this experience and have made some great strides towards getting to path 1 finish of getting the AI model to test what it should be doing. We started in Google Colab and then moved to vscode. 
We made this git repository to be able to see the progress and be able to update.

We started this project in Pytorch and have stuck through it. With a lot of help, we learned some new skills to take into the real world and what to bring into the workforce. With this amazing opportunity, we have started to learn more about 
what it takes to go into the deep for how to train the AI of the images. With the help of Anna, we got a good file reader since ours was not striving and causing a lot of major issues. All the USDA and helpers were so amazing to work with, 
they all have had great insight into these AI models and training. We started with a basic idea and research of how to get this done as a team of four who have never once touched AI modeling or anything with AI. This has made a great 
opportunity to give it a try when we might not normally step out of the box to try.

This Hackathon has brought us together in a new way of being able to collaborate in different ways to solve Path 2 which we later switched to Path 1. Trying to get the training and reading files in. We got to training to work, 
and then the files switched, and were unable to reload the images in. We have been through the research and watched what others have done before to be able to get a good understanding of what we were trying to do and learn more about 
different methods others have taken towards teaching AI to look at images, which might not be the same task, but it does not mean their insight was. We found it to help us learn more about Machine Learning.
